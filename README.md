My space for thoughts, data, and analysis of our plague.

###### Legal/License

I have provided no license intentionally; data herein are compiled from
as many sources as I have been able to find, listed and referenced where
possible. I will
absolutely not partake in the deceptive practice of granting
a license of content for which I do not have the right to provide.

If you're cool, be cool. Use whatever you want here. If you do something
awesome, credit me, if you feel like it. And make sure you credit
the original data sources and consult their approval for use.

And if you're doing something with this that requires a license, again,
not happening! :cheers:
